To successfully run the CPU scheduler simulation, download the main.cpp, input.txt, and main.exe files
and place them in the same folder. Then, open a command prompt in the same folder as the files and
run "main < input.txt"
There should be instantaneous output of processes starting and stopping as well as a summary
once all processes are done.
